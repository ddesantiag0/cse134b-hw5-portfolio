## Deliverables

### Part 1: CustomElement Creation (20 pts)

- **Custom Element:**  
  I implemented a custom `<project-card>` element using the CustomElements API. This element is styled using CSS variables and laid out using CSS grid on the Projects page.

- **Deliverable A:**  
  > **Note:** Due to a technical oversight, I was not able to take separate screenshots for Deliverable A. Please refer to the repository code and live deployment for visual confirmation.

- **Deliverable B:**  
  > **Note:** I was unable to capture a separate screenshot for Deliverable B; however, the source code in my repository fully demonstrates the custom element's implementation.

### Part 2: Data Loading (40 pts)

- **Data Loading Functionality:**  
  The Projects page includes two buttons: **Load Local** and **Load Remote**.  
  - **Load Local:** Fetches project data stored in localStorage and dynamically populates `<project-card>` elements.  
  - **Load Remote:** Uses a remote JSON endpoint (via the JSONBin API) to fetch project data and dynamically creates project cards.

- **Demonstration:**  
  The live deployment demonstrates both functionalities. Additional screenshots (or a short video) in the repository show:  
  - LocalStorage data being loaded into project cards.  
  - Remote data being fetched and rendered.

### Part 3: Other Enhancements (10 pts)

- **Enhancements Made:**  
  - A smooth theme toggle (light/dark mode) that remembers user preference via localStorage.  
  - A back-to-top button available on every page.  
  - Social media icons in the footer linking to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.  
  - Improved login and account creation forms with tooltips, password matching verification, and a show/hide password option.

- **README Explanation:**  
  The repository README contains a short paragraph (15–30 seconds read) explaining these enhancements and the rationale behind them.

### Part 4: Other Extra Credit – Extra Credit B (CRUD Actions)

- **CRUD Actions:**  
  I implemented a separate page, **crud.html**, that allows for basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on project data stored in localStorage. This page includes:  
  - A form to add new project data.  
  - A dynamically updated list of project items.  
  - Edit and delete buttons for each project.

- **Extra Credit Affirmation:**  
  I attempted Extra Credit B – CRUD Actions. Please refer to the link to **crud.html** in my repository for confirmation.

## Additional Notes

- **Commit History:**  
  Due to time constraints, I committed all changes in one large commit rather than multiple incremental commits. Although incremental commits are ideal, the single commit in my repository contains all necessary updates for this assignment.

- **Testing and Verification:**  
  The live deployment of my site allows you to test all functionalities—including the theme toggle, data loading, back-to-top button, login/sign-up forms, and CRUD actions. Please review the repository and deployment for complete details.
