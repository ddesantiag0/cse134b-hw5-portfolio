# Enhancements and Improvements

For this final project update, I refined my portfolio site by improving the overall design and functionality. In Part 1, I implemented custom `<project-card>` elements for a modern, dynamic project display. In Part 2, I replaced hard-coded project data with JavaScript that dynamically loads projects from both localStorage and a remote JSON endpoint, ensuring seamless content updates. In Part 3, I enhanced the visual styling across the site—refining the dark and light mode themes so that both use a consistent “card” look with clear shadows and borders—and added a persistent theme toggle across all pages. These changes improve both the aesthetics and usability of the site while streamlining the user experience across various devices and environments.
